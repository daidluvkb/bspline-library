# bspline-library
A C++ implement for evaluating bspline cureves and surfaces. Simple and neat naming style makes the source code easy to read. Display part is based on GL interfaces, but algorithm implement is decoupled with the display module, so it's easy to dissociate the bspline part. Also for easier to use, factory mode is added in the entrance of the lib.
